# Hakchi RetroArch Conversion Mod 

This module will convert your mini into a dedicated RetroArch machine!

Please ensure that you install the latest RetroArch Neo from the Hakchi ModStore or [Hakchi Resources](https://hakchiresources.com)before installing this mod!

### How to use

1. Make sure you have the latest RetroArch Neo installed
2. Install the Hakchi RetroArch Conversion Mod
3. Reboot
4. Good to go!

If you exit RA via the RA menu, the Nintendo interface will be loaded as normal. This mod will ideally be used with the recently added playlist support in RetroArch Neo.

**Please Note:** There is one known issue where if you Install/Remove hmods using Hakchi CE, once complete, you need to pull the power out and reboot. The reason is that CE will try the launch the Nintendo UI but because it was never loaded there is nothing to load! This doesn't cause any harm to your console you just need to manually reboot by the power cord. (Sorry about that!)
